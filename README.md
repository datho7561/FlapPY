# FlapPY

This is a simple remake of the classic mobile game, Flappy Bird. It was started
 in order to help me learn the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) library, and I
 slowly started adding components onto it until it got much more complicated
 and interesting.

## Installation

The installation for this game is unfortunately complicated. I have written out
 steps in order to make the installation easier.

### Windows
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed and can run it from Command Prompt or
 Windows PowerShell. To verify this, open Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell,
 and type:
  `py --version`
 If this gives you an error, you need to install Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/)
2. If you don't have it installed yet, install the pygame library by running the
 command:
  `py -m pip install pygame`
 in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell. If you are unsure if you have pygame
 installed, run the command anyways.
3. Download the source code by clicking the green download or clone button and
 selecting the ZIP option. Unzip the downloaded file. If you are familiar with
 Git and/or Github, you can clone the repository instead for this step.
4. Run the Flappy.py file in Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell by typing `py`
 (with a space after), dragging the main file, `Flappy.py` into the command
 window, and hitting enter.
 **Please note that you could try to run the code in IDLE. However, I'm not sure
 if the pygame library would load, and if the library doesn't load the game
 crashes. This would happen if you installed Anaconda.**

### macOS/Linux
I haven't tried to run the program in these operating systems, but these steps
 should work:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed and can run it from Terminal. To
 verify this, open Terminal and type: `python3 --version` If this gives you an
 error, you need to install Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/)
2. If you don't have it installed yet, install the pygame library by running the
 command: `pip3 install pygame` in Terminal. If you are unsure if you have pygame
 installed, run the command anyways.
3. Download the source code by clicking the green download or clone button and
 selecting the ZIP option. Unzip the downloaded file. If you are familiar with
 Git and/or Github, you can clone the repository instead for this step.
4. Run the Flappy.py file in Terminal by typing `python3` (with a space after),
 dragging the main file, `Flappy.py` into the command window, and hitting enter.
**Please note that you could try to run the code in IDLE. However, I'm not sure
if the pygame library would load, and if the library doesn't load the game
crashes. This would happen if you installed Anaconda.**
