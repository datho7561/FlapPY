# FlapPY

This is a simple remake of the classic mobile game, Flappy Bird. It was started
 in order to help me learn the `pygame` library, and I slowly started adding
 components onto it until it got much more complicated and interesting.

## Installation

In the future, I plan to build this game into an .exe using `pyinstaller`, but
 until then, you will have to install it manually, which can be involved.
 Here are the steps you need to take to install it:

### Windows
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed and can run it from command prompt or
 Windows PowerShell. To verify this, type `py --version` into command prompt or
 Windows PowerShell. If this gives you an error, you need to install Python.
2. If you don't have it installed yet, install the pygame library by running
 `py -m pip install pygame` in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell.
3. Download the source code (or clone it if you are familiar with Git/Github)
4. Run the Flappy.py file, either in your preferred Python IDE, IDLE, or in
 Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell (by typing `py `, dragging the file into
 the command window, and hitting enter)

### macOS/Linux
I haven't tried to run the program in these operating systems, but it should
 work if you have Python 3 and pygame installed.

## Dependancies
